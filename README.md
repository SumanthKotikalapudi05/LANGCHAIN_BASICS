# LANGCHAIN_BASICS

This repository is dedicated to documenting my **fundamental understanding and exploration of the [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/) framework** â€” a powerful toolkit for building applications powered by language models.

The primary goal of this repo is to provide:
- Hands-on experiments with LangChainâ€™s core components
- Personal notes, working examples, and snippets directly derived from the official documentation
- A growing base of knowledge that evolves with my learning journey

## ðŸ“š What is LangChain?

**LangChain** is a framework that simplifies the development of LLM (Large Language Model)-powered applications by chaining together various components like prompts, models, memory, agents, and tools. It is especially useful when building:
- Chatbots
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- LLM agents and tool-using systems
- AI workflows and pipelines

##  Learning Source
All examples and insights here are based directly on the official LangChain documentation. I aim to follow their examples closely while occasionally adding personal insights or extensions.

---

## Work In Progress
This repository is a continuous work in progress. I will keep adding notebooks, notes, and examples as I explore more components of LangChain.
